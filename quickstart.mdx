## Tutorial: Your First Agent in 10 Minutes

Build a fully functional "Email Summarizer" agent step-by-step.

### What You'll Build

An AI agent that:
- Reads email content from files
- Summarizes key points in 3 bullet points
- Identifies sender intent (question, request, FYI)
- Suggests appropriate reply actions

**Time:** 10 minutes
**Skill Level:** Beginner
**Prerequisites:** AgentBuilder installed (see above)

---

### Step 1: Create a Project (1 min)

#### Launch AgentBuilder

If not already running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

AgentBuilder opens to the main dashboard.

#### Create New Project

1. Click **"+ New Project"** button (center of dashboard)
2. **Project name:** `email-summarizer`
3. Click **"Create"**

**What happens:**
- New project folder created in your workspace
- Canvas opens with main agent card in center
- Right panel shows agent configuration

✅ **Checkpoint:** Canvas displays with purple main agent card labeled "New Agent"

---

### Step 2: Configure Main Agent (3 min)

The **main agent card** is your agent's brain. Let's configure it.

#### Set Basic Information

1. Click the **main card** (purple gradient card in center)
2. Right panel opens with configuration options
3. Fill in:

**Name:**
```
Email Summarizer
```

**Description:**
```
Analyzes emails and suggests appropriate responses
```

**Icon:** Click icon → Select 📧 (or any emoji you prefer)

#### Write System Prompt

Scroll down to **System Prompt** section and enter:

```
You are an email assistant. When given email content, analyze it and provide:

1. **Summary:** 3 bullet points of key information
2. **Intent:** Classify as Question, Request, FYI, or Complaint
3. **Suggested Action:** Recommend appropriate response

## Guidelines
- Be concise and actionable
- Identify urgency level (High/Medium/Low)
- Extract any deadlines mentioned
- Note if CC'd recipients need responses

## Output Format
📧 **Email Summary:**
• [Key point 1]
• [Key point 2]
• [Key point 3]

**Sender Intent:** [Classification]
**Urgency:** [Level]
**Suggested Action:** [Specific recommendation]
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear role definition ("You are an email assistant")
- Specific output structure (numbered list)
- Explicit format example
- Actionable guidelines

✅ **Checkpoint:** Main card now displays "Email Summarizer" as title

---

### Step 3: Add a Skill (2 min)

Skills give your agent capabilities. Let's add file reading so it can access emails.

#### Find File System Skill

1. Look at **left sidebar** (Skills section)
2. Scroll to find **"File System"** skill (or use search)
3. Skill shows icon 📁 with "File System" label

#### Add to Canvas

1. **Drag** the File System skill from sidebar
2. **Drop** onto canvas (anywhere to the right of main card)
3. Skill node appears on canvas

#### Connect to Main Agent

1. **Hover** over main agent card
2. **Connection handles** appear on edges (small circles)
3. **Click and drag** from the **right handle** (right edge of main card)
4. **Drop** on File System skill node
5. Blue connection line appears

**Connection rules:**
- Only main agent card can connect to other nodes
- Right handle → Skills
- Each handle can have only one connection

✅ **Checkpoint:** Blue line connects main agent card to File System skill

---

### Step 4: Configure Claude Settings (2 min)

Set the AI model and permissions for your agent.

#### Open Claude Settings

1. Click **main agent card** (if not already selected)
2. Scroll down in right panel to **"Claude Settings"** section
3. Expand if collapsed

#### Configure Model

**Model:** Select `claude-sonnet-4-5`

**Why?** Balanced performance and cost for email summarization.

| Model | Best For | Speed | Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| claude-opus-4-5 | Complex reasoning | Slow | High |
| **claude-sonnet-4-5** | **General tasks** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| claude-haiku-4-0 | Simple tasks | Fast | Low |

#### Set Parameters

**Temperature:** `0.3`
- Lower = more consistent and focused
- Higher = more creative
- Email summarization needs consistency

**Max Tokens:** `2048`
- Sufficient for detailed summaries
- Not excessive for simple task

#### Configure Permissions

Scroll to **Permissions** section:

**Allow** (green checks):
- ✅ `read` - Agent can read files
- ✅ `list_allowed_directories` - Agent can browse folders

**Ask** (yellow question marks):
- ⚠️ `write` - Agent must ask before writing

**Deny** (red X):
- ❌ `execute` - Agent cannot run commands
- ❌ `delete` - Agent cannot delete files

**Why these permissions?**
- Email reading only needs `read` access
- Writing is rare (ask first for safety)
- Execution and deletion are unnecessary

✅ **Checkpoint:** Claude Settings show sonnet-4-5, temperature 0.3, read permissions allowed

---

### Step 5: Test Your Agent (2 min)

Time to see your agent in action!

#### Create Test Email

First, create a sample email file:

```bash
# Create test file in your workspace
cat > test-email.txt << 'EOF'
